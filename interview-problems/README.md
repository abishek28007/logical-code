####  longest-substring

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

####  longest-palindromic-substring

A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same backwards and forwards. Given a string, s, find the longest palindromic substring in s.


####  validate-balanced-parentheses

####  reverse-linked-list

Given a linked list, reverse it.

####  sort-3-unique-number

Given a list of numbers with only 3 unique numbers (1, 2, 3), sort the list in O(n) time.

####  two-sum

You are given a list of numbers, and a target number k. Return whether or not there are two numbers in the list that add up to k, do it in a single pass of the list.

####  non-duplicate-number

Given a list of numbers, where every number shows up twice except for one number, find that one number in o(1) memory.

####  non-decreasing-array

Given an array of integers in an arbitrary order. Return whether or not it is possible to make the array non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element to any value.
